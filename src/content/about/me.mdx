Hi there, Iâ€™m CaptainOfPhB, a <u>front-end developer</u> from Shanghai, China.

At present, I have 5 years of experience on front-end development, and working with React for over 4 years. I have been developing backend management system for most of my work. I write clean and simple code, and always try to find the right way to solve problems in my work.

Outside of work, I like to self-driving travel with friends, or sometimes cook at home on weekends.

Like most of programmer, I have two lovely cats which have been with me over 4 years.

I learn English and some new techniques in my spare time. I would appreciate it if you could teach me anything new to me.

Feel free to contact me if you can offer me a better job or just wanna make friend with me.
